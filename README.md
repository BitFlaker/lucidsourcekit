## Introduction

**LucidSourceKit** is an all-you-need toolkit for lucid dreaming, storing and rating dreams as well as for getting statistics about your dreams and goals. The main focus lies on providing a safe and secure environment for storing dreams and offering a lot of useful tools. **Privacy** and an **ad-free** experience are some of the primary goals.<br/><br/>
Currently the following main features are implemented:
* Protecting the app using **pin, password or biometrics**
* Getting an **overview** of settings, alarms, general information and more
* Creating **dream journal entries** with **plain text or by filling out a form**
* Attatching **recordings** and **tags** to dream journal entries
* **Categorizing** and **rating** dream journal entries
* **Sorting and filtering** entries in the dream journal
* Looking out for tasks or objects during the day to complete **goals**
* Getting an insight into the **statistics** about your dreams and goals
* Playing **binaural beats** with additional background sounds and an optional **auto-playback-stopping feature**
* **Customizing** the features of the app to your needs
* Many more features in the future...

## Privacy
It is being tried to ensure that all the data you store in the app stays in the app as long as you do not export it. Everything is saved locally on the phone in a folder that only this app has access to. The app does not have the permission for using the Internet. Because of this you can't log in with any account and it is very unlikely that your data will be shared with others. Exceptions would be data automatically processed by Android devices and other data transfers that I am not aware of. If you notice any kind of privacy issue, feel free to report it in the [Issues](https://github.com/BitFlaker/lucidsourcekit/issues) section.

## Supported languages
* English
* German (NOTE: currently very poorly supported, but will be improved in the future)
