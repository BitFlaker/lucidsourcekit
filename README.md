## Introduction

**LucidSourceKit** is an all-you-need toolkit for lucid dreaming, storing and rating dreams as well as for getting statistics. The main focus lies on providing a safe and secure environment for storing dreams and offering a lot of useful tools. **Privacy** and an ad-free experience are some of the primary goals.<br/><br/>
Currently the following features are implemented:
* Protecting the app using **pin, password or biometrics**.
* Getting an **overview** of settings, alarms, general information and more.
* **Changing the language** on the fly.
* Creating **dream journal entries** with **recordings, plain text or by filling out a form**.
* **Categorizing** and **rating** dream journal entries.
* **Sorting and filtering** entries in the dream journal.
* Looking out for tasks or objects during the day to complete **goals**.
* Playing **binaural beats** with additional background sounds and an optional **auto-playback-stopping feature**.
* Many more features in the future...
